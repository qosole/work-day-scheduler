# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

A website that allows the user to schedule a 9 AM to 5 PM work day. Events that you enter will be saved to your browser's cache. The page will update its UI based on the current time, as well as display the current date.

This project was nice practice in using a little bit of Bootstrap, jQuery, Moment.js, and using JSON to store objects in local storage.
